#Problem Number 1
print("Hello World")
# This program is able to show any word that you input. 

#Problem Number 2
hi=("Hey There")
name=(" Alex")
greeting = hi + name
print(greeting)
#This program is able to show a greeting to someone when they input their
#name into the program.

#Problem Number 3
hi=("Hey There")
name=(" Professor Sunham Num")
names= (" and Alex")
greeting = hi + name + names
print(greeting)
#This program is able to show a greeting for two people by
#inputting two different names into the program.

#Problem Number 4
r= int(input("    "))  #get the radius from a user
p= 3.14
a=p*r**2
print("The area of the given radius ", a)
#This program is able to show the area of a circle. You can
#input the radius of any circle and it will find the area.

#Problem Number 5
m= int(input("  "))
g= int(input("  "))
mpg = m/g
print(mpg)
#This program is able to show you the MPG. Once you input
#the miles and the gallons of gas, it will be able to compute
#the answer.

#Problen Number 6
F = int(input("  "))
C= (F-32)* 5/9
print(C)
#This program is able to convert any Fahrenheit temperature to
#the Celsius temperature. Input the Fahrenheit and it will be able
#to compute the degrees in Celsius.

#Problem Number 7
#0=Sunday
#1=Monday
#2=Tuesday
#3=Wednesday
#4=Thurday
#5=Friday
#6=Saturday
#Start day =int(input("  "))
#length= int(input("  "))
#x= start + length 
#y= Day%7
#print(y)
start =int("3")
length= int("10")
x= start + length
y= x%7
print(y)
#This program is able to compute what day of the week 
#you will get if you input a day and how many days you
#will return by. This program is perfect for telling what day
#you will return from a trip if you input the day you leave
#and how many days you will be gone for.
