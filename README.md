# Python-Code-Samples

Hello Everyone!

This is Alex, I am here to show my examples of how I used python to be able to solve the examples in the 
lab 3 assignment. Each of the examples could have any input and they could still run the way that they are supposed to run.
Input any number or name for the examples and it would be able to print the name or the answer for you. Python is great 
at being able to solve any problem that you have. 

From Alex.
